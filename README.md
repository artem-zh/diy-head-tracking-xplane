# diy-head-tracking-xplane

## Overview

A plugin part of my experimental gyro-based head tracking system (another part is
a [server][server-part]).

The main idea is, why not try using smartphone's gyroscope sensors for
X-Plane head tracking, because most of us have smartphone nowadays.

It's in very early state, there're still tons of things to do.
